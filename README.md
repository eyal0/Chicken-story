# Chicken Story

**tl;dr**: Crowdsourced cheating at Microsoft's Club Bing game to get prizes.

# Intro

[Club Bing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Bing) is a set of games that ran from 2007-2012.  The games were all word games that you could play online to win points and those points could be used at the online prize store to buy prizes.  One of the games was called Chicktionary.  The goal was to use 7 letters to make as many words as possible.
